    "# Running Marlowe Contracts without Blockchain Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture provides an overview of the low and high levels at which one can create and interact with Marlowe contracts on the blockchain using the Marlowe CLI tool, and how that relates to using Marlowe Run or the Marlowe Playground's simulator. It introduces the `marlowe-cli` tool and includes instructions for installing and using it. Subsequent lectures focus on particular levels of interaction with Marlowe contract using `marlowe-cli`."
