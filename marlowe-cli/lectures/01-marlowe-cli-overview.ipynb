    "# Overview of Marlowe CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture provides an overview of the low and high levels at which one can create and interact with Marlowe contracts on the blockchain using the Marlowe CLI tool, and how that relates to using Marlowe Run or the Marlowe Playground's simulator. It introduces the `marlowe-cli` tool and includes instructions for installing and using it. Subsequent lectures focus on particular levels of interaction with Marlowe contract using `marlowe-cli`."

    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The `marlowe-cli` tool enables developers to submit transactions and interact from the command line with Marlowe contracts on the Cardano blockchain, just as the `cardano-cli` tool has enabled them to do so for plain transactions, simple scripts, and Plutus scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Use Cases***\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Facilitation of internal development and testing of Marlowe contracts.\n",
    "    1.  Measuring transaction size.\n",
    "    2.  Submitting transactions.\n",
    "    3.  Testing wallet integrations.\n",
    "    4.  Debugging validators.\n",
    "2.  Early access to Marlowe capabilities on testnet and mainnet.\n",
    "3.  Integration with external developer’s workflows and toolsets for Marlowe contracts, similar to how the Cardano development community has heavily integrated `cardano-cli` into various services (libraries, faucets, token minting, marketplaces, etc.).\n",
    "4.  Incorporation into training for use of Marlowe."
